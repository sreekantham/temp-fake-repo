# PMIC Test & Measurement System

## Project Overview

This repository contains requirements and design documentation for a high-precision Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC) designed for test and measurement applications.

## Product Description

The PM-5000 Series PMIC is a multi-channel power management solution optimized for automated test equipment (ATE), precision measurement instruments, and laboratory power supplies. It provides:

- 4 independent programmable voltage rails (0.5V - 5.0V)
- High accuracy output regulation (±0.1%)
- Low noise performance (<50µVrms)
- Fast transient response (<10µs settling time)
- Comprehensive telemetry and monitoring
- I2C/SPI digital control interface

## Target Applications

- Automated Test Equipment (ATE)
- Oscilloscopes and Logic Analyzers
- Data Acquisition Systems
- Precision Measurement Instruments
- Laboratory Power Supplies
- Semiconductor Characterization Tools
